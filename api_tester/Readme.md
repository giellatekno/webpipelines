# Api tester

A simple terminal app that tries many different endpoints on the
webapi, to see which ones seem to be working.

# Running

It's a rust application, so as long as rust is installed, just

`cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to run with optimizations).

If you want to clean up the built app, just `cargo clean`.
