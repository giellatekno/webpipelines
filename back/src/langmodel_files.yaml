# Files that the fst api needs - or more precisely: wants.
# Files that do not exist will disable features for the languages that
# does not have it.
#
# Structure:
# The root is a list called "files", each element is an object with
# the following properties:
# - filename: string   (required)
#     name of the file. If it contains the specific substring "{lang}", that
#     indicates that the name of the file will be replaced by the same language
#     as the repository. For example, "paradigm_standard.{lang}.txt" would
#     be named "paradigm_standard.sme.txt" in the "lang-sme" repository.
# - alt_filename: string   (optional)
#     name of the alternative file. Sometimes, a command can accept both a
#     pre-compiled binary file, or the source version of the file. If this
#     field is specified, it indicates an alternative such file that will also
#     be searched for.
# - repo_path: string   (required)
#     full path to where the file is located. it may or may not need to
#     be built before it is available. The same replacement string "{lang}"
#     may be present here.
# - shared_by: list of string    (?)
#     Some files are the same for many languages, and they therefore only
#     exist in a shared repository. For example, the "dependency.cg3" file is
#     shared for all sami languages.
# - repo: string
#     If shared_by (above) is given, this property specifies the repository
#     the file resides in. For now this is literally just shared-smi to
#     my knowledge, but potentially it could have been other shared folders.
# - needs_build: boolean  (defaults to True)
#     If False, it indicates that the file specified by repo_path is
#     available without needing to build the models
# - build_flags: list of string   (defaults to [])
#     If the file needs to be built, this list specifices any additional
#     flags that must be passed to --configure for the build to make this
#     file
# - needed_by_langs: list of string   (?)
#     In general, all files are needed by all languages, but there are
#     files that only exist for some languages, so that some functionality
#     is only available for some languages. This is by design - there just
#     has not been any linguistic work put into making it work for all
#     languages. An example is paradigms: They do not exist for all languages.
# - methods: list of string   (?)
#     The API endpoints this file is used in
